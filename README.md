# SPY_VIX_MeanReversion_Basic
I did this project for Professor Kohler's FINA 4350 class in spring '23.

Summary: I investigated whether large VIX up-moves tend to precede periods of higher than average risk-adjusted returns. I find evidence that very large VIX up-moves(as measured by certain std day/day changes in points & closing price std) capture elevated ERP. I analyze buying and holding SPY for 1-year hold times following a two week lag after generated signals.
